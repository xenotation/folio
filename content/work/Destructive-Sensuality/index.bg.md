Destructive Sensuality is a video collage investigating the specifics of commercial video codec degradation. Based on key moments in Bulgaria’s visual subconscious made up of vital videos, it uses various methods of controlled im- age destruction and degradation based on structural compression in videos. Destructive Sensuality is a pop-up exhibition by Sofia Dimova and Nikola Stoyanov, where the two artists romanticize the destructive dynamics of sensual experiences that imperceptibly become part of our everyday lives. But like everything that comes quickly, it also goes the same way, leaving an apocalyptic trail in its wake. Dimova and Stoyanov tap into the searing sensations in a direct way that reveals both vulnerability and audacity.
