In examining the fragility and neglect of memory in contemporary Bulgaria, "Humor is the politeness of despair" serves as a commentary on the publicness of memory and its remembrance. In an age where info-blitzes overwhelm, selective memory becomes a societal curator, determining what endures and what fades into obscurity. This project delves into the forgotten corners of Bulgarian internet culture, resurrecting political scandals and legendary humor videos that now exist as cryptids in the digital realm.

The piece part of a collaboration with Sophia Dimova named Destructive Sensuality, intentionally employs early 2000s editing aesthetics and video degradation techniques. Through techniques like datamoshing and deliberate distortions, it confronts viewers with environments both nostalgic and eerie. These digital collages transport audiences into realms where memory blurs with strangeness, echoing the relentless churn of digital content mill.

Symbolically staged as a TV within a mundane home setting, the installation evokes late-night transmissions—a nod to the clandestine dissemination of cultural fragments, often overlooked or intentionally forgotten. The soundtrack further underscores this exploration, juxtaposing a Bulgarian chalga anthem on the topic of drunk driving with music typically used in contemporary TikTok montages, bridging generational divides in media consumption and memory formation.

Ultimately, Nikola Stoyanov's work challenges us to confront the indifferent nature of the internet—a vast repository that dictates what is remembered and what is erased. "Destructive Sensuality" invites reflection on the interplay between digital decay and cultural memory, urging us to navigate a landscape where nostalgia intertwines uncomfortably with fleeting digital artifacts.

Destructive Sensuality is a video collage investigating the specifics of commercial video codec degradation. Based on key moments in Bulgaria’s visual subconscious made up of vital videos, it uses various methods of controlled im- age destruction and degradation based on structural compression in videos. Destructive Sensuality is a pop-up exhibition by Sofia Dimova and Nikola Stoyanov, where the two artists romanticize the destructive dynamics of sensual experiences that imperceptibly become part of our everyday lives. But like everything that comes quickly, it also goes the same way, leaving an apocalyptic trail in its wake. Dimova and Stoyanov tap into the searing sensations in a direct way that reveals both vulnerability and audacity.
