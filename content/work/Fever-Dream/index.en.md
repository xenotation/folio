This zine is an exploration of the human experience with fever dreams, weaving personal narratives collected from diverse individuals.

Nikola Stoyanov combines these stories with his own digital collages of etchings, creating a visual representation of the dreamscapes born from elevated temperatures. As the zine delves into the historical context of our responses to diseases and the role of ancient deities like "Februus" and "Dea Febris," it becomes a unique blend of past and present.

The accompanying digital collages not only illustrate the tales but also serve as modern sigils, capturing the essence of purification and protection against the ever-evolving landscape of infectious threats.

This booklet becomes a tapestry of shared human experiences, melding art, history, and the surreal realms of fever-induced dreams.
