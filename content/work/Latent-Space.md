Latent space is where the gaze of artificial intelligence itself draws a picturesque horizon, delving into the hidden rooms of secret research facilities, investigative organizations, classified databases. An imaginary space that the machine illuminates, exposing the postmodern subjectâ€™s built-in subversiveness of aesthetic experience in its internal mechanics, referentiality and element of incompleteness. The so-called noise in communication theory is a recognized information field defying systematization. Instead, the algorithm constructs faces, machines, corridors and cloud spaces in a process of incom- pleteness. Until recently, the paranoia of ungrounded fact has become the factual divergence from the referencial matrix.
