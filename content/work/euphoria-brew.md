Euphoria brew is modern Bulgarian gypsy brewing brand focused on filling a niche in flavor profiles that is rarely attempted on the Bulgarian market. In this sense it demands a visual register that is at the same time referring to its Dionysian roots in the Black Sea coast, as well as a sophisticate character reminiscent on high class clubbing culture. In this sense a combination between contemporary minimalist graphic design is combined with a retrofitted note of psychedelia. As every market and clients has different demands and constraints, in this case that most of the product being distributed is in kegs and not the classical bottle or can, the focus has been shifted to creating assets that can easily translate both to the digital as well as the physical domain, focusing more on social media interaction, building and familiarizing a just now emerging audience with modern yet timeless aesthetic. Base on a number of cryptic references to its origin combined with the inherently Dionysian character of the tarots illustration the design seek to remind the consumer of the hidden mysteries that a good night out hides and feeling of intimacy on only get after a few drinks.
