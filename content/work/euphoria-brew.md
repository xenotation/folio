Euphoria brew is modern Bulgari- an gypsy brewing brand focused on filling a niche in flavor profiles that is rarely attempted on the Bulgarian market. In this sense it demands a visual register that is at the same time referring to its Dionysian roots in the Black Sea coast, as well as a sophis- ticate character reminiscent on high class clubbing culture. In this sense a combination between contemporary minimalist graphic design is combined with a retrofit- ted note of psychedelia. As every market and clients has different demands and constraints, in this case that most of the prod- uct being distributed is in kegs and not the classical bottle or can, the focus has been shifted to creat- ing assets that can easily translate both to the digital as well as the physical domain, focusing more on social media interaction, build- ing and familiarizing a just now emerging audience with modern yet timeless aesthetic. Base on a number of cryptic refer- ences to its origin combined with the inherently Dionysian character of the tarots illustration the design seek to remind the consumer of the hidden mysteries that a good night out hides and feeling of in- timacy on only get after a few drinks.
