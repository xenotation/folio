The city - transfigured into a gray zone emptied of people, of lights, immersed under water or discarded in the wild cosmos, folded beyond prac ticality, it represents a capsule emptied of its nature, emptied of its structures of power, emp- tied of its social bodies. A dispositive without practice, without knowledge and expertise, with out our institutions and without time - a pure assemblage. The project presents a virtual city-scape assembled out of distorted models of our familiar urban environment. A photogrammetric landscape through the view of microsecond tics of satellites, lit knowingly and aimlessly, a virtual dérive of Varna’s unconscious. Nikola Stoyanov was born in Varna in 1994 and has received a classical education in philosophy and history of technology in the UK. His interests include the intersection of infrastructure and technology with art and everyday life. A trans- lator and photographer he likes to intertwine the humanities with technology. Despite his heavy focus on photography as an artistic medium, his work often crosses this border into abstract ex- pression and digital generative art.

GrayZone Dispositive is a massive photogrammetry recreatingthe urban space of Varna. Based on satellite images of the city, it presents its double. The videogame installation also relies on acuttingedge AI-denoiser, a technology whose artifacts contribute to distort the visual field intoa dreamlike watercolor drawing. An initial version of Grey Zone Dispositive, in the form of a videoinstallation, was presented as partof the exhibition Temporary Crisis, part of the Sofia Underground Festival (2022). Later, the developed video game was part of theexhibition „RE:Process“ in the cityof Varna (continuation of the exhi-bition „In Process“, 2021).
