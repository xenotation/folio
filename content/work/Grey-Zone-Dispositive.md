The city - transfigured into a gray zone emptied of people, of lights, immersed under water or discarded in the wild cosmos, folded beyond practicality, it represents a capsule emptied of its nature, emptied of its structures of power, emptied of its social bodies. A dispositive without practice, without knowledge and expertise, withoout our institutions and without time - a pure assemblage. 

The project presents a virtual city-scape assembled out of distorted models of our familiar urban environment, rearanged into a non-euclidian vista. A photogrammetric landscape attained through the view of microsecond tics of satellites, scanning the earths surface porpouslfully and aimlessly, a virtual dérive of Varna’s unconscious, in the form of an intereactive dream.

Grey Zone / Dispositive is a massive photogrammetry recreatingthe urban space of Varna. Based on satellite images of the city, it presents its double. The videogame installation also relies on acuttingedge AI-denoiser, a technology whose artifacts contribute to distort the visual field intoa dreamlike watercolor drawing. An initial version of Grey Zone / Dispositive, in the form of a videoinstallation, was presented as partof the exhibition Temporary Crisis, part of the [Sofia Underground Festival](https://sofiaunderground.com/%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%85%d0%b8%d0%b2/su-x0xx/) (2022). Later, the developed video game was part of the exhibition [„RE:Process“](https://newdegeneration.xyz/work/re-process/) in the city of Varna (continuation of the exhi-bition [„In Process“](https://newdegeneration.xyz/work/in-process/), 2021).
