      <title>Postcards and Contraband</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Postcards and Contraband&amp;rdquo; begins by examining a work archive of the Bylgarian Customs Agency, Directorate for Combating Drug Trafficking from 1975-1985. The service notes, photographs, negatives, summaries and reports found mark part of the routine of the Customs Agency work, such as inspection and regulation of transit, but also the diplomatic image the Customs Agency must maintain to the international community.
The leading suspicion here is that the found archives give only a partial insight into the organized &amp;ldquo;hidden transit&amp;rdquo; - a term behind which the communist government of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of Bulgaria concealed the smuggling trade carried out by the State Security through commercial enterprises and organizations.</description>

      <title>Nature Morte</title>

      <description>NATURE MORTE is a multimedia project that plants the philosophical question firmly into the ground - on a part of the country&amp;rsquo;s highly restricted critical infrastructure. In an attempt to find different approaches to reach the excavation and its visualization, open data from satellite and geological surveys and measurements were used, through which the digital topography of the mines has been built.
The visuals obtained from satellite images can be called operational, as a continuation of the &amp;ldquo;operational image&amp;rdquo; coined by the German director Harun Farocki, denoting &amp;ldquo;images that do not represent an object, but are part of an operation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Latent Space</title>

      <description>Latent space is where the gaze of artificial intelligence itself draws a picturesque horizon, delving into the hidden rooms of secret research facilities, investigative organizations, classified databases. An imaginary space that the machine illuminates, exposing the postmodern subject’s built-in subversiveness of aesthetic experience in its internal mechanics, referentiality and element of incompleteness. The so-called noise in communication theory is a recognized information field defying systematization. Instead, the algorithm constructs faces, machines, corridors and cloud spaces in a process of incom- pleteness.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;RE:PROCESS&amp;rdquo; exhibits photographs of everyday urban objects. In the construction and deconstruction traces can be found upon the urban surface, a peculiar language, through which different modalities of appearance are formed and unfolded. Easily found but tough tо comprehend the signs, grilles, and hanging cables will be our entrance to a forgotten archive of urban fabric. What remains hidden here is the photographic eye behind the camera obscura, looking at the image-reality, in a stance not of drifting in the world but being seduced by it.</description>

      <description>The city - transfigured into a gray zone emptied of people, of lights, immersed under water or discarded in the wild cosmos, folded beyond practicality, it represents a capsule emptied of its nature, emptied of its structures of power, emptied of its social bodies. A dispositive without practice, without knowledge and expertise, withoout our institutions and without time - a pure assemblage.
The project presents a virtual city-scape assembled out of distorted models of our familiar urban environment, rearanged into a non-euclidian vista.</description>

      <description>The exhibition is nomadic in nature, led by the Black Sea, which is without harbour and without shore, far from the clear squawk of a sea bird. A malevolent curse, brought where it does not belong - in the mountain foothills. This preliminary note outlines the possible geography of pictorial existence, beyond concrete space.
I-IXA is an expressionistic turn towards pure abstraction. A move that preserves the artist&amp;rsquo;s technicality while hiding his gesture in the finished paintings.</description>

      <description>The drive to capture the city as an affective totality was what led to the inception of this project. Thought, structured and implemented over the urban grid it draws a hyper-fiction. Its origins lie in the delirium of government documents, their leaks and their inaccessibility. Its target, the return to the archive. IN:PROCESS aims to present photographs of objects from the everyday urban space. In the processes of construction and disintegration, marks are found on the urban surface, a kind of language through which various modalities of appearance are formed and developed.</description>

      <title>Music for a New Night Life</title>

      <description>Music for a New Night Life deals with Mark Fishers concept of hauntology and lost futures. It visually shows a cymatic matrix of a city in flux, of its dreams and nightmares and finally of its reality filled with nostalgia. The tidal feeling of turbulence wroth by the ancient currents of the Black Sea returns us to a state of Freudian unconsciousness, a downcast euphoria, somatically revealing the subject to the base nostalgia of Oedipal separation.</description>
