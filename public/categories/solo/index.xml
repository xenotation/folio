      <description>NATURE MORTE is a multimediaproject that plants the philosophical question in the ground - on a part of the country’s criticalinfrastructure, where access is highly restricted. In an attempt to find different approaches to reach the excavation and its visualization, open data from satellite and geological surveys and measurements were used, through which the digital topography of the mines was built.
Although the cosmic time of geoformation - the million-year superimposition of layers that proceeds in relative calm, where separate elements barely interact, there are also short periods of ruptures recorded in the layers.</description>

      <description>Latent space is where the gaze of artificial intelligence itself draws a picturesque horizon, delving into the hidden rooms of secret research facilities, investigative organizations, classified databases. An imaginary space that the machine illuminates, exposing the postmodern subject’s built-in subversiveness of aesthetic experience in its internal mechanics, referentiality and element of incompleteness. The so-called noise in communication theory is a recognized information field defying systematization. Instead, the algorithm constructs faces, machines, corridors and cloud spaces in a process of incom- pleteness.</description>

      <description>RE:PROCESS exhibits photographs of everyday urban objects. In the construction and deconstruction traces can be found upon the urban surface, a peculiar language, through which different modalities of appearance are formed and unfolded. Easily found but tough tо comprehend the signs, grilles, and hanging cables will be our entrance to a forgotten archive of urban fabric. What remains hidden here is the photographic eye behind the camera obscura, looking at the image-reality, in a stance not of drifting in the world but being seduced by it.</description>

      <title>И-ИКСА</title>

      <description>Настоящaта изложба е номадска по природа, водена от черното море, което е без пристан и без бряг, далеч от ясния крясък на морска птица. Злокобна прокоба, довята там, където не принадлежи – в планинското подножие. Тази предварителна бележка очертава възможната география на живописната екзистенция, отвъд конкретното пространство.
И-ИКСА е експресионистичен завой към чистата абстракция. Ход, който съхранява техничността на автора, същевременно скривайки неговия жест в завършените картини. Те биха могли да носят имена като КУЧИ БОЙ, НАРКОМАНСКА ХВАТКА, ОБСЕСИЯ, което би ги затворило в нарочно тълкуване.</description>

      <description>The drive to capture the city as an affective totality was what led to the inception of this project. Thought, structured and imple- mented over the urban grid it draws a hyper-fiction. Its origins lie in the delirium of government documents, their leaks and their inaccessibility. Its target, the re- turn to the archive. IN:PROCESS aims to present photographs of objects from the everyday urban space. In the pro- cesses of construction and disin- tegration, marks are found on the urban surface, a kind of language through which various modalities of appearance are formed and de- veloped.</description>

      <title>Music for a New Nigh Life</title>

      <description>Music for a New Night Life deals with Mark Fishers concept of hauntology and lost futures. It vi- sually shows a cymatic matrix of a city in flux, of its dreams and night- mares and finally of its reality filled with nostalgia. The tidal feeling of turbulence wroth by the ancient currents of the Black Sea returns us to a state of Freudian unconsciousness, a downcast euphoria, somatically revealing the subject to the base nostalgia of Oedipal separation.</description>
