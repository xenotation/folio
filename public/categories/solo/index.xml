      <description>The second showing of the now upgraded exhibition took place in Sofia. The exhibition had two sites: one at the Harta Gallery and another installation piece, &amp;ldquo;The First Ten&amp;rdquo; by Nikola Stoyanov, on the window display of Posta art space on one of the capital&amp;rsquo;s busiest boulevards.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Postcards and Contraband&amp;rdquo; has its inception in an incidentally found archive from the Bulgarian Customs Agency, Directorate &amp;ldquo;Struggle Against Narcotics Trafficking,&amp;rdquo; from the period 1975-1985.</description>

      <title>Nature Morte</title>

      <description>Nature Morte is a multimedia project that plants the philosophical question firmly into the ground - on a part of the country&amp;rsquo;s highly restricted critical infrastructure. In an attempt to find different approaches to reach the excavation and its visualization, open data from satellite and geological surveys and measurements were used, through which the digital topography of the mines has been built.&#xA;The visuals obtained from satellite images can be called operational, as a continuation of the &amp;ldquo;operational image&amp;rdquo; coined by the German director Harun Farocki, denoting &amp;ldquo;images that do not represent an object, but are part of an operation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Latent Space</title>

      <description>Latent space is where the gaze of artificial intelligence alone draws the picturesque horizon, delving into the hidden rooms of secret research centers, intelligence organizations, and classified databases. An imagined space that the machine illuminates, exposing the postmodern subject&amp;rsquo;s built-in subversiveness of aesthetic experience in its internal mechanics, referentiality, and element of incompleteness. The so-called noise in communication theory is a recognized information field that does not lend itself to systematization.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;RE:PROCESS&amp;rdquo; exhibits photographs of everyday urban objects. In the construction and deconstruction traces can be found upon the urban surface, a peculiar language, through which different modalities of appearance are formed and unfolded. Easily found but tough t–æ comprehend the signs, grilles, and hanging cables will be our entrance to a forgotten archive of urban fabric.&#xA;What remains hidden here is the photographic eye behind the camera obscura, looking at the image-reality, in a stance not of drifting in the world but being seduced by it.</description>

      <description>The exhibition is nomadic in nature, led by the Black Sea, which is without harbour and without shore, far from the clear squawk of a sea bird. A malevolent curse, brought where it does not belong - in the mountain foothills. This preliminary note outlines the possible geography of pictorial existence, beyond concrete space.&#xA;I-Ixa is an expressionistic turn towards pure abstraction. A move that preserves the artist&amp;rsquo;s technicality while hiding his gesture in the finished paintings.</description>

      <description>The drive to capture the city as an affective totality was what led to the inception of this project. Thought, structured and implemented over the urban grid it draws a hyper-fiction. Its origins lie in the delirium of government documents, their leaks and their inaccessibility. Its target, the return to the archive. In:Process aims to present photographs of objects from the everyday urban space. In the processes of construction and disintegration, marks are found on the urban surface, a kind of language through which various modalities of appearance are formed and developed.</description>

      <title>Music for a New Night Life</title>
      <link>//192.168.5.102:8080/work/music-for-a-new-nighlife/</link>

      <guid>//192.168.5.102:8080/work/music-for-a-new-nighlife/</guid>
      <description>Music for a New Night Life deals with Mark Fishers concept of hauntology and lost futures. It visually shows a cymatic matrix of a city in flux, of its dreams and nightmares and finally of its reality filled with nostalgia. The tidal feeling of turbulence wroth by the ancient currents of the Black Sea returns us to a state of Freudian unconsciousness, a downcast euphoria, somatically revealing the subject to the base nostalgia of Oedipal separation.</description>
