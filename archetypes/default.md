NATURE MORTE is a multimediaproject that plants the philosoph-ical question in the ground - ona part of the country’s criticalinfrastructure, where access ishighly restricted. In an attempt tofind different approaches to reachthe excavation and its visualiza-tion, open data from satellite andgeological surveys and measure-ments were used, through whichthe digital topography of the mineswas built.Although the cosmic time ofgeoformation - the million-yearsuperimposition of layers thatproceeds in relative calm, whereseparate elements barely interact,there are also short periods ofruptures recorded in the layers.The excavation of rocks, clay,minerals, stones and ash unfoldsthe earth’s bowels, from wheretraces of long-sunken worlds aremade visible. This is where ouroperational activity on the criticalinfrastructure of the Maritza-Iztokmines begins.
